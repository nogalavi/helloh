CategoryFinder finds a category for a given testname, by taking the categoty that has maximum score.
The score is calculated by looking at the pre-given testname-category table, and counting how many times
a word from the input appears in any test related to the category.

Please see usage example at "UsageExample" class.

for example:
testname = "HDL Hemoglobin"
Table =
["HDL Total Hemoglobin", "Hemoglobin"],
["Hemoglobin", "Hemoglobin"],
["Cholesterol total", "Cholesterol"]

The cagtegory "Hemoglobin" will have the score of 3 (2 matches in the first entry, 1 in the second),
while the category "Cholesterol" will have the score of 0 (no word of the testname appears in any of it's related tests.

The Category "Hemoglobin" has the highst score, therefore, it will be chosen.
